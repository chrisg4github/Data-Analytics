## Surf's Up project.

The climate data for Hawaii was provided through two CSV files. Python and Pandas were used to inspect the content of the files and clean the data.

- Created a Jupyter Notebook file called data_engineering.ipynb, used Pandas to read in the measurement and station CSV files as DataFrames.

- Inspected the data for NaNs and missing values, and removed the NaNs.  Saved the  clean CSV files.
- SQLAlchemy was used to model the table schemas, and a sqlite database was used for the tables. 
- Analysis and plotting was completed using SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  Plotted the results using the DataFrame plot method.




#### Technologies

- Jupyter Notebook, Data analysis and cleansing, DataFrame.plot(), Flask API.
