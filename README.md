## Surf's Up project.

The climate data for Hawaii is provided through two CSV files. Using Python and Pandas to inspect the content of these files and clean the data.

●     Create a Jupyter Notebook file called data_engineering.ipynb, use Pandas to read in the measurement and station CSV files as DataFrames.

●     Inspect the data for NaNs and missing values. You must decide what to do with this data.  Save your cleaned CSV files.

SQLAlchemy is used to model the table schemas, and a sqlite database is used for the tables. 

Analysis and plotting was completed using SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.
